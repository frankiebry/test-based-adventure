### Todo
- [ ] Right now the monster moves randomly, make the monster "chase" or follow the player?
- [ ] Make it so that if the monster is in a nearby cell the players smells something foul
- [ ] Make it so that if the treasure is in a nearby cell the players can see a glittering aura
- [ ] Make it so that the monster can grab the treasure too?
- [ ] Add typewriter effect
- [ ] Add inventory using a dictionary
- [ ] Display available commands

### Issues
- [ ] If the player types "go " + anything other than a cardinal direction, it just says "the way is blocked"
- [ ] Functions need to be better named and commented
