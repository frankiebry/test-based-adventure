### Todo
- [ ] Typo RIGHT in the title... change "test" to "text
- [ ] Coordinate system is not intuitive, come up with something easier to understand
- [ ] Map symbols are not intuitive, come up with something easier to understand
- [ ] Right now the monster moves randomly, make the monster "chase" or follow the player?
Maybe the monster moves to the last lit torch location?
- [ ] Make it so that if the monster is in a nearby cell the players smells something foul
- [ ] Make it so that if the treasure is in a nearby cell the players can see a glittering aura
- [ ] Make it so that the monster can grab the treasure too?
- [ ] Add inventory using a dictionary
- [ ] Display available commands
- [ ] Add code that checks if main?
- [ ] Welcome message + display available commands
- [ ] Type help to display commands again (monster doesn't move)
- [ ] Cheat command instead of debug (monster doesn't move)
- [ ] When lighting a torch, draw an actual map as a grid

### Issues
- [ ] If the player types "go " + anything other than a cardinal direction, it just says "the way is blocked"
- [ ] When there is one torch left it says "you have 1 torches left"
- [ ] When the player is standing on the treasure it just shows a T and not an O
- [ ] Functions need to be better named and commented
- [ ] Comment everything that doesn't have a clear purpose
