# Treasure Hunt
My attempt at creating a text based adventure game using a coordinate system and a grid map. Run the game in CMD or Linux terminal from main.py. Python must be installed.

Alt code symbols for the map found [here](https://www.alt-codes.net/square-symbols).

ANSI escape codes for colors for the map icons found [here](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797)
