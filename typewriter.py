    Simulates typing out a message one character at a time with a specified speed.

    message (str): The message to be typed out.
    speed (float): The delay (in seconds) between each character.

    The function outputs the message one character at a time, with a delay between each character to create a typewriter effect.
    If the character is a newline, it waits longer before continuing to the next line.
